## Autoencoder
In order to run the autoencoder code, some steps need to be completed first:
1. Download the .pt files from this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1w7GfDKQ_wsClzP8fkrbpOe-Q4nRMjGaj?usp=sharing. These files go in the saved_models folder within the autoencoder folder.
2. Download the data from this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jzoYxJuIaClt9Q_tloYxK06tuAJrYAFi?usp=sharing. These files go in the data folder within the autoencoder folder.
3. Now, you can either open the autoencoder folder within the simCLR folder with VS Code and run the main.py file or you can navigate to the folder through the terminal and run the following command:
```
python3 main.py
```
4. This will run the code for the autoencoder portion of the project.
